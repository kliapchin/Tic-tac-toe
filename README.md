# Tic-tac-toe
This game of Tic Tac Toe was the first Python program that I had ever written.

Although pretty simple, it was a very significant achievement for me at the time. Having taught myself Python in my free time, I was amazed that after a mere few weeks I was able to build something complete, something that worked, and something I could actually show to my family and friends without having to get technical.

Seeing what I was able to build from scratch in such a short period of time felt great and only made me more hungry to continue learning and improving my skills in Python, as well as other programming languages.

# Description
This program contains a simple 2-player game of Tic Tac Toe, which can be downloaded and run straight on the Terminal on Mac or the Command Prompt on Windows.
